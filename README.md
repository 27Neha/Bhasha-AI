# Bhasha-AI 🌐  
**Multilingual AI Assistant for Indian Languages**

Bhasha-AI is an AI-powered multilingual assistant focused on enabling interaction in **Indian regional languages**. The project aims to improve accessibility and usability of AI systems for users who prefer or require communication in their native language.

The application is deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces** and provides an interactive interface for real-time language-based AI responses.
